This is a smart city IOT project which is used to detect and control Illumination levels,noise levels,potholes and show the real time data in the app.It uses various sensors including BH170 for lux levels,gps module for geolocation,raspberry pi for data gathering and procesing. Data is received and stored in Firebase cloud. Web app will show each area with its current levels of the sensors in real time.Pothole detection is done using Ultrasonic sensor placed in the bottom of the cars of the city and also using Lidar sensors and image procesing using cameras installed at various locations.Also,the illumination levels in the street lights will be smartly controlled using IR and ultrasonic or pressure sensors by analysing the traffic flow and density.
